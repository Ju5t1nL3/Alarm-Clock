# Alarm Clock

This program takes user input on a certain amount of time then starts an alarm clock. Once the timer finishes, the alarm sound will play! If you would like to run this program, simply download the python file and mp3 file. Then pip install time and pip isntall playsound. When trying to install playsound, you may get an error: subprocess-exited-with-error. If so, pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel, then try pip installing playsound again.
